# CRDBCompare

The project aims to create a Python script that compares two schemas in Postgres. The script should compare each table, grants, and other table properties line by line. The project has a two-week deadline and requires the creation of a to-do list and work item.

# Scope:
    The Python script will compare two schemas in separate CockroachDB databases. The script will compare each table, grants, and other table properties line by line, and output the differences between the two schemas in a user-friendly format.
# Requirements:
    1. The Python script should be able to connect to two separate CockroachDB databases.
    2. The script should be able to retrieve the schema information for both databases.
    3. The script should compare each table, grants, and other table properties line by line, highlighting any differences between the two schemas.
    4. The script should output the differences between the two schemas in a user-friendly format, such as a table or a report.
    5. The script should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
    6. The script should be able to handle large schemas and datasets efficiently.
    7. The script should be documented with clear usage instructions and examples.
# Optional Requirements:
     1. The script could provide a summary of the differences between the two schemas, such as the total number of differences, the types of differences, or the percentage of differences.
     2. The script could provide options to filter or ignore certain types of differences, such as differences in whitespace or comments.
     3. The script could support customization of the output format or style, such as HTML or markdown.
     4. The script could support automated testing or integration with a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

# Additional Info
   
1. **Design the architecture**: Plan the overall structure of the script, including the main functions and classes, as well as the flow of data between them.
2. **Set up the environment**: Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed, such as `psycopg2` for connecting to CockroachDB and `tabulate` for displaying the comparison results in a readable format.
3. **Establish database connections**: Write a function to connect to both databases using the provided connection details (e.g., host, port, user, password, and database name).
4. **Retrieve schema information**: Write functions to retrieve schema information for both databases, including table names, column names, data types, constraints, grants, and other table properties.
5. **Compare schemas**: Write a function to compare the retrieved schema information from both databases. This function should identify any differences between the two schemas, such as missing or extra tables, columns, constraints, or grants.
6. **Generate comparison report**: Write a function to generate a human-readable report of the comparison results, highlighting any differences between the two schemas. This report can be displayed in the console or saved to a file.
7. **Implement error handling**: Add error handling to the script to ensure that it can gracefully handle any issues that may arise during execution, such as connection errors or missing schema information.
8. **Testing**: Test the script with various scenarios to ensure that it accurately compares the schemas and generates the correct output.
9.  **Documentation**: Write clear and concise documentation for the script, including comments in the code, a README file, and any necessary user guides.
10. **Deployment**: Package the script for distribution and deployment, ensuring that all dependencies are included and that the script can be easily installed and executed by users.
11. **Maintenance and support**: Provide ongoing support for the script, addressing any bugs or issues that may arise and updating the script as needed to accommodate changes in CockroachDB or Python.

## Work Items:

1. Research CockroachDB Python API for schema comparison.
2. Develop a prototype script to compare two schemas in CockroachDB.
3. Test the prototype script with sample data.
4. Refine the prototype script based on feedback.
5. Implement error handling and performance improvements.
6. Test the final script with a larger dataset.
7. Document the script and provide usage instructions.
8. Review the code and documentation with a peer or team member.

## Follow-Up Questions

- What are the specific table properties to be compared?
- What are the consequences of not completing the project within the two-week deadline?
- What are the potential challenges in comparing separate databases?
- What are the expected outputs of the Python script?
- What are the criteria for determining the success of the project?

## Arguments and Areas for Improvement

- The project may require significant time and resources to complete within the two-week deadline.
- There may be unforeseen challenges in comparing separate databases that may affect the accuracy and completeness of the comparison.
- The Python script may not be able to capture all the necessary table properties for an accurate comparison.
- The project may require specialized knowledge and skills in Postgres and Python programming.
- The project may not be feasible if the schemas are too complex or large.
